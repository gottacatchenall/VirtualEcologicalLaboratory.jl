All selection mechanisms are defined as 

```
f(m::T, old_state::State, new_state::State)

end
```


The existing selection mechanisms are :

1. Density-dependent selection (`./density_dependent.jl`).

Density dependent selection defines the selection function 

$f(x)$


2. Directional selection
3. Disruptive
4.
