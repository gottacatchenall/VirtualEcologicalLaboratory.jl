# VirtualEcologyLab.jl

[`VirtualEcologyLab.jl`](https://gottacatchenall.github.io/VirtualEcologyLab.jl/dev/)
is a Julia library for simulating ecological and evolutionary experiments.
`VEL.jl` aims to create a  "virtual laboratory" (Grimm & Railsback 2005) for ecological
and evolutionary processes.

`VEL.jl` composes models based on five mechanisms:
`Selection`, `Drift`, `Dispersal`, `Mutation`, and `Speciation`. These
mechanisms can operate on different types of measurements (`Biomass`,
`Abundance`, `Occupancy`, `ContinuousTrait`, `DiscreteTrait`), and be combined
to create arbitrarily complex systems of ecological and evolutionary dynamics
using few lines of code (see [the example](#example))

`VEL.jl` is part of [EcoJulia](https://github.com/EcoJulia), and has interfaces
to other packages in the EcoJulia ecosystem (EcologicalNetworks.jl,
SpatialEcology.jl, Diversity.jl) and uses
[`EcoSISTEM.jl`](https://github.com/boydorr/EcoSISTEM.jl) as a simulation engine
for scalable parallelized simulation.

`VEL.jl` is currently in alpha and will have a tagged `v0.1` release when fully
functional.

# Primer

This is a quick primer on how the software is designed.

## Measurements

A **measurement** is information about an ecological or evolutionary system that
can be written down. Within `VEL`, measurements are split into two types:
`Biotic` and `Abiotic`.

`Biotic` measurements correspond to things measuremed about living things. At
the moment, the types of `Biotic` measurements are:

- `Biomass` (represented as a `Float64`)
- `Abundance` (an `Int`)
- `Occupancy` (a `Bool`)
- `ContinuousTrait` (a `Float64`)
- `DiscreteTrait` (a set of `symbols` that form a dictionary)

`Abiotic` measurements correspond to the environmental conditions at a
particular location. The two broad categories of `Abiotic` measurements are
`StaticEnvironmentalMeasurement`, which is fixed in time, and
`DynamicEnvironmentalMeasurement`, which can change over time.

## States

A **state** is set of **measurements** that describes an ecological system.

- `SingletonState`: A measurement corresponding to a single species at a single location and time. (For 1D measurements, a scalar)
- `MetapopulationState`: A measurement corresponding to a single species across spatial locations. (For
  1D measurements, a vector)
- `CommunityState`: A measurement corresponding to a set of species in one location (For 1D measurements, a vector)
- `MetacommunityState`: A measurement corresponding to a set of species across spatial locations (For 1D measurements, a
  matrix)

States of different types of measurements can be grouped to create
`StateAssemblage`. For example, this is necessesary to build a
mechanism that effects the `Abundance` of species changes as a function of some species`Trait`.

## Mechanisms

Models in `VEL` are built by comining **mechanisms**. A **mechanism** describes
how a **state** of a system  changes from one time-step to the next.

Within `VEL`, mechanisms are divided in to **5** categories  (derived from
[Vellend 2010](http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1086/652373) and the established "big 4"
from the from evolutionary genetics): selection, drift, dispersal, mutation,
speciation.

### Types of mechanisms

- **Selection** describes a mechanism that alters a `BioticMeasurement`. This occurs in two ways: 1) `AbioticSelection`: where a `BioticMeasurement` changes as a function of an `AbioticMeasurement`, or 2) `BioticSelection`, where a `BioticMeasurement` changes as a function of another `BioticMeasurement`.
- **Drift** describes a mechanism that alters a `BioticMeasurement` stochastically.
- **Dispersal** describes a mechanism that alters a `BioticMeasurement` across multiple locations due to individuals of a `Species` reproducing in a different location than where they were born. Depending on the measurement the "conservation of mass" rule is different. Some dispersal models (e.g. Levins/Hanski metapopulation models)  do not enforce "conservation of mass" when species move across space. Some do. We enable both. 
- **Mutation** specifically relates to `Trait` measurement developing a novel value due to a random event.
- **Speciation** specifically relates to a `Trait` measuremeny where, for a given species emboidying a value of traits across spatial locations, the `Speciation` mechanism determines these entitites become discrete entities in the `Metaweb` (see metaweb).


### Defining mechanisms and dispatch

The form in which any individual `::AbstractMechanism` acts on a `State` is via
dispatch on

`simulate!(mech::AbstractMechanism, oldstate::State, newstate::State)`


Note that *Speciation* models are unique in its dispatch patterns because it
involves changing the metaweb, and therefore the allocation for `new_state` must
be changed because it has a different number of species. This causes general
problems. Wrap anything with a speciation model in a larger tensor with a
MAX_SPECIES param? Who knows.


### Combining mechanisms

Only models corresponding to the same measurement type can be combined to create
a `ModelAssemablage`, however multiple `ModelAssemblage`s corresponding to
different measurements can be combined into a single simulation.  

## Trajectories

A trajectory (or trajectory assemblage) is a set of states.

## Observers

VEL enables creating observers which sample from the virtual system across given
spatial and temporal patterns, and which can simulate observation error.
