The `library/` directory contains implementations of models of ecological dynamics from variousubfields. The goal is twofold: 

1) to reduce the amount of code written for common models
2) demonstrate how arbitrarily complex models of ecological dynamics can be constructed using the mechanisms in `VirtualEcologyLab.jl`
